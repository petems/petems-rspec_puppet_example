NOTES
For if you're not using forge.
For if you havent used rspec (some people expect you to have used and be familiar with Rspec)


Start off with basic rspec testing


2. describe
3. language ???
4. it..do 
5. should contain_class
6. should contain_class().with
7. populate with with variables
5. context
6. let(:params)
7. before each
8. @
9. x.should_receive vs allow
10. == vs eq




quote marks are necessary

if stdlib or other gems are required, a .fixtures.yml file can point to a local copy of it (preventing the need to git clone on each run)

puppetlabs-rspec helper

why use the ":type" thing?
describe 'repos', :type => 'class' do ??????????????


=====
MEETING WITH PETE
Oct 30th

Ask people to pull down the repo which will contain empty tests. this will prove that Rspec is working on their machine.

repo will contain;
package
service
